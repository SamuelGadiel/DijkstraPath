# DijkstraPath
> Dijkstra Path Implementation in JavaScript

## Motivation
During a computing class it was mentioned an Algorithm to find the shortest path between two given points
I got interested in the idea and started to search about it. I've found a lot of methods, concepts and implementations
So I decided to code my own implementation of the Dijkstra Algorithm, with it this project was born

A project created to study how Dijkstra Algorithm finds the shortest path between two given points
